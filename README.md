# **Data cleaning and wrangling in SQL**
This project consists of queries written in SQL to clean a housing dataset. Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. This process is important because it allows us to remove data that might negatively impact our data-based decision-making. Also, it can be a necessary step when preparing the data for machine learning or deep learning algorithms.

The steps taken in this project are explained below.

## The dataset
As previously mentioned, the dataset consists of housing data from the city of Nashville, Tennessee. It contains information on house sales, including details such as the sale price, the property address, the name of the owners, and the date the house was sold.
By running the query below, we can get access to all the information in the dataset, presented in tabular form.
```
SELECT *
FROM PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing
```
