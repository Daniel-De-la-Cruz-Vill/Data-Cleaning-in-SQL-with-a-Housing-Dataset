# **Data cleaning and wrangling in SQL**
This project consists of queries written in SQL to clean a housing dataset. Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. This process is important because it allows us to remove data that might negatively impact our data-based decision-making. Also, it can be a step prior to using the data for a machine learning/deep learning application.

The steps taken in this project are explained below.

## The dataset
As previously mentioned, the dataset consists of housing data.
```
SELECT *
FROM NashvilleHousing
```
